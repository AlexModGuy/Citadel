Citadel is a library mod intended to provide a home
to the codebase of Alexthe666 and other mod authors.
It is mainly composed of shared code for animation, rendering and entity property tracking.
It also contains a basic guidebook system, of which you are looking at right now.
The book system reads in automatically from JSON files.
Text is automatically wrapped and read in from a .txt file.
Items and blocks can be rendered, along with recipes like this:
<NEWLINE>
Like items and blocks, entities and tabula models can also be rendered.
These can either be static, rotated in any direction, or follow the
player's cursor.
<NEWLINE>
<NEWLINE>
All entities should animate properly. If the
book is unable to find said entity, it will render a
pig instead. Link buttons are useful for allowing
players to navigate books properly.
Pressing the link button will open the page
specified, then the back button should allow
the player to go back to the parent page.
